# LUKE


LUKE is a new _knowledge-enhanced_ contextualized representation of words and
entities based on. LUKE is
designed to effectively address entity-related tasks including entity typing,
relation classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. This
model achieved state-of-the-art results on popular datasets including SQuAD 1.1
(extractive question answering), CoNLL-2003 (named entity recognition), ReCoRD
(cloze-style question answering), TACRED (relation classification), and Open
Entity (entity typing). This repository contains the source code to pretrain the
model, and fine-tune the model to solve downstream tasks.

## Installation
